  Scenario: Users can efficiently perform project management in GitLab
    Given I register 'Project Owner' user via 'API'
    And I see this 'Project Owner' user is registered via 'API'
    And I register 'Developer' user via 'API'
    And I see this 'Developer' user is registered via 'API'

    When I log in to gitlab with 'Project Owner' user
    Then I can see 'Create a project' button on the 'Home Page'
    When I create a new blank project
    Then I see that project was successfully created

    Then I can leave a text comment
    And I can attach png file to comment
    And I can 'Add a to do'
    And I can 'Mark as done'
    And I can close the issue
